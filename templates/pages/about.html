<h1>About</h1>
<p>PAX provides easy interacting between PHP and AJAX while it reduces at the same time written code in Javascript and improves the way of managing and manipulating DOM elements from the backend in an object oriented style.</p>
<p>Although PAX was inspired by the awesome <a href="http://www.xajaxproject.org" >xajax-project</a> it is using a slightly different approach. PAX is a way more simple but still flexible while it makes use of abstractions and object extensions. With that approach it doesn't offer a plugin technology but makes it fairly easy to give you the power of creating your own Responder. That furthermore lowers the number of code and makes sure you include only code you really need.</p>
